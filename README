WHAT IS THIS ?
==============

This is the source distribution of the Tcl clock extension: the faster 
Tcl-module for the replacement of the standard "clock" ensemble of tcl.

You need to have your Tcl core compiled also.

This extension is a freely available open source package. You can do
virtually anything you like with it, such as modifying it, redistributing
it, and selling it either in whole or in part.  See the "license.terms"
file in the top-level distribution directory for complete information.


HOW TO COMPILE ?
================

Only Unix-like and Windows platforms are supported at the moment. Depending
on your platform (Unix-like or Windows) go to the appropriate directory
(unix or win) and start with the README file. Macintosh platform is supported
similar way the Tcl core does it also.
