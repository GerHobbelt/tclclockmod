Building the fast clock Tcl-module extension for Unix
=====================================================

Extension can be compiled on several Unix derivates including various
distributions of Linux.

To build on Unix-like operating systems:

    % ../configure ?options ...?

Either way, this will create a Makefile which you use to run "make" and
"make install":

You can use "make clean" to clean the directory from temporary compilation
files and/or "make distclean" to additionaly remove local config files.
You might want to do "make test" before doing the "make install" in order
to run the regression tests on the package.

To explore other building options, look into the file "configure" for more
information.

Example for typical build on x86 systems:

    $ cd unix
    $ ../configure --with-tcl=../../tcl8.6/unix
    $ make clean && make

Example for typical build on x64 systems:

    $ cd unix
    $ ../configure --enable-64bit --enable-64bit-vis --with-tcl=../../tcl8.6/unix
    $ make clean && make
